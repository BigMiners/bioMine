cells (CSCs) is a paradigm-shifting
approach. We hypothesized that CSCs can be targeted by interfering
with functions of sulfated glycosaminoglycans, which play key roles
in cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis. We developed a tandem,
dual screen strategy involving (1) assessing inhibition of monolayer
versus spheroid growth and (2) assessing inhibition of primary versus
secondary spheroid growth to identify G2.2, a unique sulfated nonsaccharide
GAG mimetic (NSGM) from a focused library of 53 molecules, as a selective
inhibitor of colon CSCs. The NSGM down-regulated several CSC markers
through regulation of gene transcription, while closely related, inactive
NSGMs G1.4 and G4.1 demonstrated no such changes. G2.2&#x02019;s effects
on CSCs were mediated, in part, through induction of apoptosis and
inhibition of self-renewal factors. Overall, this work presents the
proof-of-principle that CSCs can be selectively targeted through novel
NSGMs, which are likely to advance fundamental understanding on CSCs
while also aiding development of novel therapeutic agents.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>cb500402f</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>cb-2014-00402f</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="sec1">The cancer
stem-like cell (CSC)
hypothesis has attracted attention as a unifying hypothesis that explains
disease recurrence in the majority of advanced epithelial malignancies
including colorectal cancer. CSCs typically survive anticancer drug
treatment and self-renew to eventually reconstitute the entire tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The recurrence of tumor is difficult to treat with traditional anticancer
drugs that primarily target &#x0201c;bulk&#x0201d; cancer cells. A new
approach is critically needed to prevent disease recurrence arising
from inability to destroy CSCs.</p><p>Small molecule inhibition of
CSC self-renewal to eventually eradicate
tumor is a paradigm-shifting approach and presents major opportunity
for discovering of novel anticancer drugs. Yet, selective targeting
of CSC is challenging. CSCs are rare in a tumor cell population, which
implies that approaches relying on screening of bulk cancer cells
cannot succeed in identifying CSC-specific agents. Gupta et al. used
epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition in a breast cancer cell line
to enhance the proportion of CSCs, which enabled a high-throughput
screening approach. This effort led to the identification of salinomycin
as a CSC inhibitor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> This approach was
also used recently by the NIH Molecular Libraries Program to identify
several probes, for example, ML239, ML243, and ML245, as inhibitors
of breast CSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup></p><p>We reasoned that a novel approach to target
CSCs would be modulation
of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions with growth factors, cytokines,
or morphogens that play critical roles in CSC growth and/or differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Heparan sulfate (HS), a sulfated
GAG, is a recognized regulator of stem cell growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> HS and its sulfation level is also known to induce stem
cell differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Although the exact molecular mechanism of HS action
on stem cells remains unelucidated, one postulate is that HS facilitates
ternary complexation with cell surface proteins, thereby affecting
growth and/or differentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> This ternary
complexation is likely to depend on HS fine structure, which presents
a major opportunity for developing highly selective therapeutic strategies.
Likewise, a chondroitin sulfate (CS)&#x02013;containing proteoglycan
called CSPG4 is also present on CSCs and is involved in regulating
cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup></p><p>Although HS and CS play major roles in growth and
differentiation
of CSCs, they also contribute to bulk tumor cell biology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> This implies selective targeting of CSCs through
GAG modulation can be expected to be difficult from the perspective
of competing GAG modulation of bulk tumor cells also. Yet, we posited
that the significant difference in growth profiles of the two types
of cells should enable a selective targeting strategy. This reasoning
is supported in part by the differential expression of signaling pathway
components of the two types of cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Further, recent
evidence indicates that certain glycans may be aberrantly expressed
in CSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Thus, we hypothesized that intercepting
appropriate GAG&#x02013;protein interaction(s) may lead to selective
targeting of CSCs.</p><p>Recently, we developed a range of structurally
unique, synthetic
nonsaccharide GAG mimetics (NSGMs, see <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting
Information Figures S1 and S2</xref> for structures).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> These novel molecules mimic GAG structure through appropriate placement
of one or more sulfate group(s) on an aromatic scaffold. These NSGMs
have been found to modulate several biological functions including
coagulation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and oxidation in which GAGs
play important roles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Thus, if a biological
screen can be designed to exploit the difference(s) in growth characteristics
between bulk cancer cells and CSCs, then novel synthetic NSGMs that
selectively target CSCs should be possible to identify.</p><p>Herein,
we report that screening a library of 53 novel, synthetic,
and homogeneous NSGMs containing varying levels of sulfation and diverse
aromatic scaffolds resulted in identification of three NSGMs (i.e.,
G2.2, G11.1, and G12.2) that selectively inhibit the growth and self-renewal
properties of colorectal CSCs (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The
CSC inhibition activity was highly sensitive to the structure of the
NSGM. For example, closely related analogues, G1.4 and G4.1, do not
induce CSC inhibition. In the process, we have developed a novel tandem,
dual screening strategy involving inhibition of monolayer versus spheroid
growth and inhibition of primary (1&#x000b0;) versus secondary (2&#x000b0;)
spheroid growth that can be very broadly applied for anticancer chemical
biology and drug discovery. The identified NSGM down-regulated several
CSC markers through regulation of gene transcription, while closely
related, inactive NSGMs demonstrated no such changes. Moreover, the
effects on CSCs were mediated, in part, through induction of apoptosis
and inhibition of self-renewal factors. Thus, our work presents the
paradigm that NSGMs (and GAGs) represent a rich, untapped avenue for
modulation of CSCs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Selective targeting of colorectal cancer stem-like cells

and hexuronic acid residues that are variably sulfated resulting in
a natural library of millions of sequences. The core polysaccharide
scaffold primarily orients key sulfate groups in three-dimensional
space for optimal interaction with the target protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Sulfated NSGMs attempt to exploit this concept of functional mimicry
through sulfate group recognition. In fact, this concept has led to
the design of sulfated flavonoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> and sulfated
tetrahydroisoquinolines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> as mimetics of
a specific sequence in heparin using computational techniques. Likewise,
sulfated quinazolinones,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> sulfated benzofurans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> and sulfated gallolylglucopyranoses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> have also been developed as effective mimetics
of GAGs. These small, synthetic, homogeneous molecules bind in the
GAG-binding site of proteins resulting in modulation of function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> This function could be either agonistic or antagonistic. For example,
sulfated tetrahydroisoquinolines mimic the interaction of heparin
with antithrombin and thereby generate agonistic effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> In contrast, sulfated benzofurans introduce
hydrophobic as well as electrostatic interactions and result in an
antagonistic effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup></p><p>Taking into
account the role of GAGs in CSC growth and differentiation, we predicted
that a distinct NSGM may selectively target colorectal CSCs. Hence,
a small library of sulfated NSGMs was selected for screening (see <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2</xref>). As
a group, the library represented 12 distinct scaffolds, G1 through
G12, and 53 unique molecules possessing one to 13 sulfate groups,
linear length of &#x0223c;8&#x02013;24 &#x000c5; and a range of three-dimensional
shape from approximately planar (G1 scaffold) to globular (G12). Except
for the G2&#x02013;G4, G11 and G12 scaffolds, the synthesis of other
scaffolds has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> We report here the synthesis of G2&#x02013;G4 NSGMs (see <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information Schemes S1&#x02013;S3</xref>).
The synthesis of these molecules exploited the differential reactivity
of the 5- and 3&#x02032;-phenolic groups present on quercetin arising
from the differential intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The differentially
protected quercetins could then be site-selectively coupled to afford
either G2 (5&#x02013;5 coupling) or G3 mimetics (3&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032;
coupling) in high yields. Extension of this technique further led
to the synthesis of G4 group of NSGMs by coupling G2 with the G1 scaffold.
The final step is sulfation of the polyphenolic precursor using trialkylamine&#x02013;sulfur
trioxide complex under microwave conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information Schemes S4&#x02013;S8</xref>). It is important to note that the synthetic strategy developed
here provides novel variably sulfated molecules in high yields and
high homogeneity (&#x0003e;95% purity).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Results of the tandem, dual screening

of CSCs</title><p>To study the CSC-targeting ability of the sulfated
NSGMs, we utilized our earlier observation that CSCs/progenitors are
enhanced several-fold in spheroid culture compared to monolayer culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> In fact, colon HT-29 spheroids were found to
express Leu-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5),
an established CSC marker,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> several-fold
higher than cells grown as monolayers (<xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting
Information Figure S3</xref>). More importantly, CSCs grown in spheroid
condition differ significantly from monolayer counterparts with respect
to activation of key signaling pathways, for example, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin
signaling among others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> We exploited this to
develop a novel screen for identifying molecules that selectively
target colorectal CSCs. In this screen, sulfated NSGMs that inhibit
HT-29 growth under spheroid conditions, but not under monolayer conditions,
were then assessed for retention of 2&#x000b0; and 3&#x000b0; spheroid growth
inhibition profiles in the absence of NSGM. The latter screen is of
particular importance as primary spheroid growth although selective
for CSCs doses not distinguish between non-self-renewing progenitors
and self-renewing CSCs. Hence, sulfated NSGMs that satisfy this tandem,
dual screen would preferentially target self-renewing CSCs. From the
library of 53 sulfated NSGMs, 11 showed &#x0003e;50% inhibition of primary
sphere formation in HT-29 cells (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>)
without inducing any meaningful inhibition of monolayer growth (see <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information Figure S4</xref> for all results).
These 11 NSGMs belonged to G2, G4, G11, and G12 scaffolds but only
four of the six G2 molecules, one of the two G4, four of the seven
G11 and two of the five G12 molecules satisfied the first screen.
Similar results were observed for HCT-116 colon cancer cell line (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), which has a distinct genetic background compared
to HT-29 cells. Interestingly, the active G2 and G4 NSGMs showed better
inhibition of HCT-116 CSCs (p53 wild-type) as compared to HT-29 spheroids
(p53 mutant). In contrast, G11 and G12 NSGMs did not display such
a consistent trend.</p><p>The 11 sulfated NSGMs were then studied
for their effect on 2&#x000b0; and 3&#x000b0; sphere formation (HT-29 and
HCT-116) in Screen 2. By design, this screen reflects a test of true
self-renewability of CSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Single cell suspension
obtained from primary spheres formed above was then cultured in the
absence of NSGM. Only three (G2.2, G11.1 and G12.2) showed &#x0003e;50%
inhibition
in both 2&#x000b0; and 3&#x000b0; sphere formation in HT-29 cells (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Of these three, G2.2 (a dimeric sulfated flavonoid)
was especially interesting because two closely related analogues,
G1.4 (monomeric) and G4.1 (trimeric), completely failed at Screen
1 and Screen 2 stages, respectively (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). G2.2, the &#x0201c;lead&#x0201d; NSGM demonstrated a steep dose&#x02013;response
profile for primary spheroid inhibition with an apparent IC<sub>50</sub> of &#x0223c;58 &#x003bc;M (<xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information

in HCT-116 (p53 null) and Panc-1 (pancreatic) cancer cell lines with
essentially identical potency (<xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information
Figure S6</xref>). The results suggested a more generic applicability
of CSC-targeting effect of G2.2.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>G2.2 Induces Distinct Molecular

In striking contrast, G1.4 and G4.1 displayed no effect on the expression
of any of the CSCs markers tested (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and b). Additionally, flow-cytometric analyses for LGR5 showed
a similar (39%) reduction in LGR5 (hi) cells following treatment with
G2.2, but only a modest (&#x0003c;15%) decrease with G1.4 compared to vehicle-treated
controls (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). To confirm that these
changes are meaningful, we performed two control experiments with
agents known to up- or down-regulate LGR5. Considering that LGR5 is
a target of canonical &#x003b2;-catenin signaling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> exposure to an activator (GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibitor CHIR-99021)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> or inhibitor (iCRT14)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling should predictably alter expression
of LGR5. Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d results confirm these predictions
and further support the phenotypic changes induced by G2.2. Likewise,
similar findings were observed for DCLK1, another intestinal stem

which G2.2 might induce these molecular
changes, we examined expression of above CSC markers at mRNA and protein
levels at various time points. We observed a marked decrease in mRNA
levels of several CSC markers at 6 h following treatment with G2.2
compared to controls (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). With regard
to the corresponding proteins, there was minimal change at 6 h but
a significant decrease at 24 h (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).
These findings suggest that mRNA changes precede changes in protein
expression strongly supporting the notion that G2.2 regulates CSC
markers through regulation of gene transcription. Taken together,
these results provide compelling evidence that G2.2 targets CSCs at
a molecular level, which supports the phenotypic findings of spheroid
growth inhibition described above. More importantly, the structure&#x02013;activity
dependence observed between two related NSGMs suggest that the fine
structure of the molecule is critical for the CSC targeting ability.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Mechanism of G2.2 Mediated Inhibition of CSC Growth</title><p>To gain
further insight into mechanism of selective CSC targeting
by G2.2, we examined its effect on broad cellular processes in spheroid
cells. CSC growth is regulated by a fine balance between self-renewal
and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> We examined CK20,
a marker of colonic differentiation, expression in spheroid cells
grown on collagen in the presence of 2.5% serum, which is known to
promote differentiation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> following treatment
with G2.2. We observed only a modest induction of CK20 expression
following G2.2 treatment compared to vehicle treated controls using
two different methods (Western blot and immunocytochemistry, Figures <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a and b). On the other hand, G2.2 caused a significant
inhibition of self-renewal factors BMI-1 and c-MYC, while it had little
effect on OCT-4 levels (Figures <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c and d).
In comparison, the inactive analogue G1.4 induced no such changes
(Figures <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c and d). These findings suggest
that G2.2 might inhibit CSC growth, at least in part, through attenuation
of self-renewal. In fact, inhibition of BMI-1 expression in colon
cancer is being currently exploited as a therapeutic strategy to selectively
target CSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Mechanisms of CSC targeting

of CSCs, we examined cell cycle distribution as well as induction

of spheroid cells in G1 phase compared to vehicle treated controls
(Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). On the other hand, using two different
methods to examine apoptosis induction, annexin V labeling and acridine

of apoptosis in spheroid cells treated with G2.2 compared to vehicle
treated controls (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a and b). In contrast,
the inactive analogue G1.4 demonstrated no such effects (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Moreover, G2.2 did not induce apoptosis in CSC-poor
monolayer counterparts (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Overall,
the findings suggest that G2.2 selectively inhibits CSCs through induction
of apoptosis as well as attenuation of self-renewal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first report describing anticolon
CSC selective properties of a NSGM. These molecules represent a major
translational advance over naturally occurring GAGs because of their
ease of synthesis, biophysical properties (hydrophobic as well as
hydrophilic nature) and structural homogeneity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> In fact, the structural complexity of GAGs has been a major
challenge and NSGMs are likely to fulfill the major gap in availability
of GAG-like molecules.</p><p>The therapeutic and chemical biology
potential of NSGMs and GAG-like molecules is high. PI-88, a mixture
of highly sulfated oligomannans that targets growth factor signaling,
is being currently evaluated in clinical trials of various cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> However, it is not known whether PI-88 targets CSCs. NSGMs also
possesses multiple sulfate groups, in the manner of PI-88, and our
earlier work shows that they typically bind in the GAG-binding site
on proteins and modulate function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> The fine structure&#x02013;activity relationship noted in the anti-CSC
function of NSGMs suggests recognition of one or more target protein(s).
Identification of these proteins should facilitate the design of more
potent analogues. One important finding of this work is that G2.2
inhibits CSCs from several cell lines (HT-29, HCT-116 and Panc-1).
This implies that a broader anti-CSC profile is possible through NSGMs,
which should enhance the clinical relevance of these novel molecules.</p><p>Finally, our tandem, dual screen approach opens up a novel and
relatively simple avenue for not only discovering anti-CSC agents
but also identifying agents selectively targeting progenitor cells.
In fact, we discuss such an observation with G4.1. Although G4.1 belongs
to the same core scaffold as G2.2 (the flavonoid scaffold), it exerts
its effects mostly on early progenitor cells. This finding implies
that microscopic configurational and/or conformational differences
play key roles in fine-tuning selectivity for targeting CSCs or progenitor
cells. Such structural dependence of biological activity for NSGMs
has been observed earlier and highlights the possibility of using
this approach for advancing fundamental functional understating of
stem cells/progenitors biology using chemical tools.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Chemicals, Reagents, and
